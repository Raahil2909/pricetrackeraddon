1. why we need a server ?
Ans. We need to timely fetch the contents of a webpage to get the price of an item. This can be done using background.js but the issue is that we cannot easily query for items like we can when we have the access to dom of the webpage. Also it is not easy to import libraries there and hence it makes it tedious to that task from scratch.

2. Do we  need a database ?
Ans. We do need to store small amount of data but instead of using a databse we can simply store that data in user's browser

3. Do we need user accounts ?
Ans. No we dont.

4. Then how do keep track of which user wants price of which items?
Ans. We dont. We just store url in user's browser storage. Then we use alarm which is a feature given by chrome extension api. We use it to make request to server to tell us the price whenever we need i.e at intervals of say 1hr.

5. So what is the role of server exactly ?
Ans. The only thing server does is that when we send it a request it will fetch the item price and name from amazon's website and return to us 

6. keep in mind the seucrity aspect as server will be making get requests to websites. it should not be downloading malicious file by making req to random pages.

7. get or post request to server?
Ans. It is a post request as we need to send url to server which has length limit and may exceed that if sent via get request

8. are there separate alrams for all items in list ?
Ans. No there is single alarm at which all prices will be updated

9. Data Structure used to store the list of items ?
Ans. Map. As we need to remove items from it as well. This can be done efficiently using maps as it stores things as key value pairs. So the key in map can correspond to row id of the item to be removed.
